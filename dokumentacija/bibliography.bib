abstract = {A blockchain is a distributed network, which can be used as a digital ledger as well as a mechanism that enables the secure transfer of assets without a central authority. Like the Internet is a technology that facilitates the digital flow of information, blockchain is a technology that facilitates the digital exchange of units of value. Anything from currencies to land titles to votes can be tokenized, stored, and exchanged on a blockchain network. In addition to the secure transfer of value, blockchain technology provides a permanent record of transactions and a single version of the truth called a network state, which is fully transparent in real-time for the benefit of all participants. In this chapter, we briefly describe the overview of blockchain and their characteristics that defines a blockchain is a prominent technology.}
